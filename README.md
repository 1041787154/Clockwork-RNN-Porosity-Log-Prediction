# ClockworkRNN_Porosity_Log_Prediction
A Clockwork RNN model to train on compressional velocity (Vp), formation density (Rhob), gamma ray (Gr), and resistivity (Rt) logs to predict Neutron Porosity (Nphi)

The clockwork RNN model is a tensorflow implementation of Koutnik et al., 2014. This a modified implementation of tomrunia/ClockworkRNN.
